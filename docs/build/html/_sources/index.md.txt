# Welcome to TDR Targets's documentation!

TDR Targets is a bioinformatics resource focused on helping drug discovery
efforts for neglected tropical diseases.

Depending on your perspective it can be viewed as a database that can be
browsed, or as a web application that can be leveraged as a tool.

The documentation for TDR Targets provides a detailed description of the
various datasets that have been integrated, its functionality, as well as
some examples that showcase the utility of this resource.

## Introduction

The large and growing need for antiparasitic drugs (attributable to poor
efficacy, high toxicity, and/or emergence of drug resistance), coupled with
increasing interest in this area from both academic and pharmaceutical
sector research programs, has motivated the development of a "Drug Target
Portfolio" database that is accessible via the web at https://tdrtargets.org. 

This database facilitates two different approaches for identification of
drug targets and potential lead compounds against pathogens. 

``` warning:: TDR Targets recently moved to a new version release that introduced a lot of functionality changes. Make sure you read full list of changes at https://tdrtargets.org/releases.

## First Steps

Are you new to *TDR Targets*? Learn about how to quickly prioritize targets
for your pathogen of interest, or search for interesting bioactive
compounds.

## Getting started

TDR Targets facilitates two different approaches for identification of
drug targets and potential lead compounds against tropical disease causing
pathogens:
