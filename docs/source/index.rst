Welcome to TDR Targets's documentation!
=======================================

TDR Targets is a bioinformatics resource focused on helping drug discovery
efforts for neglected tropical diseases.

Depending on your perspective it can be viewed as a database that can be
browsed, or as a web application that can be leveraged as a tool.

The documentation for TDR Targets provides a detailed description of the
various datasets that have been integrated, its functionality, as well as
some examples that showcase the utility of this resource.

Introduction
------------

The large and growing need for antiparasitic drugs (attributable to poor
efficacy, high toxicity, and/or emergence of drug resistance), coupled with
increasing interest in this area from both academic and pharmaceutical
sector research programs, has motivated the development of a "Drug Target
Portfolio" database that is accessible via the web at https://tdrtargets.org. 

This database facilitates two different approaches for identification of
drug targets and potential lead compounds against pathogens. 

.. warning::

TDR Targets recently moved to a new version release that introduced a lot of
functionality changes. Make sure you read :doc:`the full list
<61-breaking-changes>`.
